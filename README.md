We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-gcp-Service-account/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Default service-account
```hcl
module "service-account" {
source = "clouddrove/service-account/google"
version     = "1.0.0"


name        = "test"
environment = var.environment
label_order = var.label_order

service_account_enabled     = true
account_id                  = "clouddrove"
project                     = "clouddrove"
service_account_key_enabled = true
service_account_id          = module.service-account.name
key_algorithm               = "KEY_ALG_RSA_2048"
public_key_type             = "TYPE_X509_PEM_FILE"
private_key_type            = "TYPE_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE"
service_account_ids         = module.service-account.name
}
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| description | A text description of the service account. | `string` | `"Managed by clouddrove"` | no |
| display\_name | A text description of the service account. | `string` | `""` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| google\_service\_account\_iam\_binding\_enabled | Flag to control the service\_account\_enabled creation. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| keepers | Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger a new key to be generated. | `map(string)` | `null` | no |
| key\_algorithm | The algorithm used to generate the key. Possible values: `KEY_ALG_UNSPECIFIED`, `KEY_ALG_RSA_1024`, `KEY_ALG_RSA_2048` | `string` | `"KEY_ALG_RSA_2048"` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. sequence of application name and environment `name`,`environment`,'attribute' [`webserver`,`qa`,`devops`,`public`,] . | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| members | Identities that will be granted the privilege in role. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| module\_enabled | Flag to control the service\_account\_enabled creation. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| name | n/a | `string` | `""` | no |
| private\_key\_type | The output format of the private key. | `string` | `"TYPE_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE"` | no |
| project\_id | The project in which the resource belongs. If it is not provided, the provider project is used. | `string` | `""` | no |
| public\_key\_data | Public key data to create a service account key for given service account. The expected format for this field is a base64 encoded X509\_PEM and it conflicts with `public_key_type` and `private_key_type`. | `string` | `null` | no |
| public\_key\_type | The output format of the public key requested. | `string` | `"TYPE_X509_PEM_FILE"` | no |
| service\_account\_enabled | Flag to control the service\_account\_enabled creation. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| service\_account\_key\_enabled | Flag to control the service\_account\_enabled creation. | `bool` | `true` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| email | The e-mail address of the service account. |
| id | The id of the service account. |
| key\_id | The id of the service account key. |
| key\_name | The name of the service account key. |
| name | The fully-qualified name of the service account. |
| private\_key | The private key in JSON format, base64 encoded. |
| public\_key | The public key, base64 encoded. |
| unique\_id | The unique id of the service account. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
